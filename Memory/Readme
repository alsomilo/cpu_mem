##Compile

./CPU/make mem_coord


##Execute

./mem_coord 5 

Note: here the argument 5 means, memory coordinator will check memory usage for each domain every 5 second
 	*If there is no input argument provide, program will throw a error message, asking for input
 	*If intput argument is 0, that is invalid and program will throw a error message, asking to give a non-zero value


##Code description

	# High level algorithm 
        Everytime when memory coordinator is triggered (At time internal of X second), we need to go through all the domains and find out the memory usage for each domain.
        This is done by API: virDomainMemoryStats, by reading the output memstats tagged by VIR_DOMAIN_MEMORY_STAT_AVAILABLE.

        ocne this is done, we can find out the domain with minimum memory allocated and maximum memory allocated. 
        Two threshold are defined here below

               "above this threshold, we consider this domain is wasting memory"       

            --------------------------- MEM_WASTE_THRESHOLD ---------------------------


               "in between these two thresholds, we consider this domain is using adequate memory"
                "this is the region where mem_coord needs to get all domain into" 

            
            --------------------------- MEM_STARVE_THRESHOLD ---------------------------

               "below this threshold, we consider this domain is starving of memory" 


There are 3 cases and corresponding solutions, memory cordinater needs to handle:

        /*Case 1: min memory domain is starving && max memory domain is wasting*/
        /*Solution: take out memory from wasting domain and allocate it to starving domain*/


        /*Case 2: min memory domain is starving, max memory domain is NOT wasting*/
        /*Solution: just add memory to starving domain only*/


        /*Case 3: max memory domain is wasting, min memory domain is NOT starving*/
        /*Solution: just reduce memory from wasting domain only*/


API virDomainSetMemory is used to add/reduce memory to/from the starving/wasting domain
